# Chapter 1.1: What is "Programming"?
Within this chapter, I cover what programming truly is and how it relates to computers

You may have seen the words "programming" or "coding" used before, but what do they truly mean? First, let's understand what programming itself is.  
Let's say your friend wants to bake this amazing cake you made before. In order to do this, your friend has to know *how* to make the cake. One way they could learn how to make this cake is by reciving a recipe from you. So you pull out a paper and pencil and quickly scribble down the recipe for the cake:
```
Mix eggs and flour
Put in Pan
Put in Oven
```
Your friend recieves this recipe and repeats the steps as you wrote them and eventually recreates this amazing cake. This is programming in a nutshell. In this case, you are the programmer, your friend is the computer, and the recipe is a "script". You, the programmer, writes up a recipe, a script, and give it to your friend, the computer, who follows the instructions on the recipe, the script, and then gets results. Programmers write a script (which is just a text file with instructions for the computer to execute) that is passed to the computer which the computer executes. That's all programming really is. By becoming a programmer, you are essentially learning to give instructions to a computer for the computer to do.  
Now you may have heard programmers say things such as "Python" or "Javascript" or "HTML" and so on. You might know that these are programming languages, but do you know the difference between them?  
Let's go back to the cake analogy. You write your friend the recipe as normal:
```
Mix eggs and flour
Put in Pan
Put in Oven
```
You then send the recipe to your friend. But there is now a problem: Your friend only speaks spanish so after he takes a look at the notes, he still has no clue on how to make this cake. He simply doesn't know what `Mix eggs and flour` means or what any of the other instructions mean. So in order to be able to communicate, you must write the recipe in spanish:
```
Mezcla los huevos y harina
Ponlos en un sarten
Metelos al horno
```
When you send this recipe to your friend, this time he is able to understand the instructions and properly make the cake. This is essentially what programming languages are. While it is a bit more complex than that (See Addendum 1.1), the general gist is that different programming languages are different in that they are spoken differently. Taking a look at a more complex example, while in Python this is perfectly acceptable:
```py
print("Hello World!")
```
It is not acceptable in a language such as Javascript or C++. As opposed to what is shown above, Javascript requires something along the lines of:
```js
window.print("Hello World!");
```
Or in C++, where printing is also done as:
```cpp
std::cout << "Hello World!";
```
The main takeaway from this idea should be that different programming languages are written differently. While it is more complex then this with certain languages being better at others in certain situations, this basic overview should be enough for now (Keep in mind this is simply an introduction to programming, not a course for learning everything about it).  
So to recap, programming is just writing down instructions and handing them to a computer and having the computer execute those instructions. While this knowledge isn't exactly essential, it's good to know as you get to understand what programming itself is.
