If you are reading this, chances are you want to learn how to program or do all the hacker-man stuff you see on television. I want to start off by saying one important point: **While programming is relatively simple, it requires you to want to learn to get far.**  
As far as programming goes, it's pretty simple. You are essentially handed a bunch of tools and told to fix an item. You are given the tools to get the job done and all you really have to know is how to use said tools. But the problem with programming is that **you need to want to learn to use the tools, or you won't know what to do.** While doing the bare minimuim may allow you to get far at first, you will plateu at some point and be lost when you don't know what basic tools do.  
So ask yourself this: **Do I really want to learn how to program? Can I read paragraphs of text and try to understand it to the best of my ability and possibly reread it when I don't understand something? Am I prepared to rack my brain solving a simple problem and not just giving up because something doesn't make sense? Am I ready to ask questions when I'm confused?** If you want to program, all of these must be true. You must be **willing** to learn in order to become a proficient programmer.  
Still here? Good, let's continue.
